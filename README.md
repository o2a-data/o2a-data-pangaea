# o2a-data-pangaea

[O2A](https://www.awi.de/data-flow) consists of a comprehensive set of solutions designed to support users in their scientific workflows.  Among other tasks, we are dedicated to publish examples of analysis tools for supporting direct access to various backends (flat files, relational databases, hadoop, etc).

The "o2a-data-pangaea" specifically provides examples on how to dowload, perform basic analysis and visualize datasets archived in [PANGAEA](https://pangaea.de) using Jupyter Notebooks.  The examples require  [pangaear](https://github.com/ropensci/pangaear).  For further examples in Phyton, visit [pangaeapy](https://github.com/pangaea-data-publisher/pangaeapy). 



# Examples 

In this section we list all examples which have been developed so far. The list will be growing as an increasing number of use cases for O2A are being tested.


Example | Description 
--- | --- 
[Example 1](example1_excelFile.ipynb) | Analytics and visualization of data extracted from a Microsoft Excel file 
[Example 2](example2_pangaea.ipynb) | Analytics and visualization of temperature parameter from a mooring as extracted from a PANGAEA dataset [![DOI:10.1594/PANGAEA.884546](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.1594/PANGAEA.884546.svg)](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.884546)
[Example 3](example3_collection.ipynb) | Analytics and visualization of temperature parameter from CTDs as extracted from a PANGAEA collection [![DOI:10.1594/PANGAEA.860066](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.1594/PANGAEA.860066.svg)](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.860066)
